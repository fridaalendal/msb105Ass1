## Introduction

What is this paper about?

Reproducibility and replicability lie at the core of modern scientific practice. Scientific knowledge is built on the assumption that results can be verified, either by reusing the same data and methods (reproducibility) or by conducting new studies with comparable designs (replicability). However, numerous studies ans large-scale projects have demonstarted that a substantial share of published findings cannot be reproduced or replicated (McNutt, 2014; loannidis, 2005). This phenomenon has contributed to what is often referred to as the "replication crisis", initially recognized in psychology but increasingly evident across various scientific disciplines.

This assignment addresses the importance of reproducibility and replicability in scientific research.

## Literature review

Smart stuff from others about the topic.

Use a least 20 citations, a least 5 of them must be new (not from the provided .bib file).

Use both in-line and normal citations.

Example:

@gentleman2005 argues that bla bla bla.
On the other hand it's claimed that bla bla [@barbalorenaa.2018; @bartlett2008].

## Discussion of the reseach question

-   Should replicability be the norm or is this to much to ask for now?
-   Can Quarto documents help with reproducibility?
-   What problems remains and how can these be solved?
