## Introduction

What is this paper about?

Reproducibility and replicability lie at the core of modern scientific practice. Scientific knowledge is built on the assumption that results can be verified, either by reusing the same data and methods (reproducibility) or by conducting new studies with comparable designs (replicability). However, numerous studies ans large-scale projects have demonstarted that a substantial share of published findings cannot be reproduced or replicated (McNutt, 2014; loannidis, 2005). This phenomenon has contributed to what is often referred to as the "replication crisis", initially recognized in psychology but increasingly evident across various scientific disciplines.

This assignment discusses what reproducibility entails, why it os a fundamental requirement for scientific progress, and the consequences when this ideal is not fulfilled. Furthermore, it highlights key challenges such as publication bias, type 1 errors, and incentive structures in academia, before turning to possible solutions. Among these, the use of open data and code archives, as well as the development of "computable documents" through tools such as R Markdown and RStudio, will be emphasized. The purpose is to demonstrate how technological and methodological innovations can support a more robust, transparent, and trustworthy scientific practice.


## Literature review

Reproducibility is often described as a cornerstone of scientific progress, yet there is no single agreed-upon definition of the concept. According to @goodman2016, reproducibility refers to the ability to obtain the same results when re-analysing the original data using the same methods. Replicability, on the other hand, requires that new data collected under the same conditions yield consistent findings (see also @nosek2015). This distinction in important, since much of the ongoing debate in the so-called "replication crisis" relates not only to computational reproducibility but also to the broader credibility of research results. 

One major challenge to reproducibility is **Publication bias**. Studies with statistically significant or "positive" results are more likley to be published, whereas null finding often remain in the "filer drawer" [@rosenthal1979]. As a consequence, the published literature can become skewed towards type 1 errors, that is, false positives where the null hypothesis id incorrectly rejected [@simmons2011]. For instance, @ioannidis2005 provocatively argued that "most published research findings are false", a claim supported by multiple large replication projects. 


Smart stuff from others about the topic.

Use a least 20 citations, a least 5 of them must be new (not from the provided .bib file).

Use both in-line and normal citations.

Example:

@gentleman2005 argues that bla bla bla.
On the other hand it's claimed that bla bla [@barbalorenaa.2018; @bartlett2008].

## Discussion of the reseach question
A central question is whether replicability should be the norm. From a philosophical perspective, science recuires replication to establish generalisable knowledge. Without replicability, findings remain anecdotal. However, demanding universal replicability may be too ambitious in the short term. contextual differences, limited resources, and methodological diversity make replication challenging in fields such as psychology and biomedicine. It may therefore be more practical to promote transparency and reproducibility as immediate priorities, while striving for replicability as a long-term goal. 

Technological tools such as Quarto documents offer significant progress for reproducibility. By integrating code, data, text, and results in a single file, Quarto ensures that analyses can be rerun and verified by others. This reduces the risks of documented steps, selective reporting, or errors that weaken reproduceibility. Moreover, QuartoÂ´s ability to output to multiple formats makes it easier to share reproduceible research across disciplines. However, while Quarto improves computational reproducibility, it cannot guarantee replicability, which requries new data and independent confirmation. 

-   Should replicability be the norm or is this to much to ask for now?
-   Can Quarto documents help with reproducibility?
-   What problems remains and how can these be solved?
